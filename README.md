# Shift Scheduler

Shift Scheduler is an Android application designed for workers at a metal factory with a four-shift schedule.  

Users can select their brigade, and the calendar highlights each day in different colors to show day shift, night shift, rest day, or off day.  

This app makes it easy to see your work schedule at a glance and plan your days efficiently.
